This is an example from the small library I wrote for the research project I am working on with the High Energy Physics Group at UH Manoa.

I am including two Python files, `maths.py` contains functions for dealing with Pandas dataframes and `physics.py` contains functions for physics calculations.

The functions themselves include descriptions in the form of docstrings.

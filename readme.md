This is example Python code from the research project I am working on with the High Energy Physics Group at UH Manoa.

I am including two files. `maths.py` contains functions for dealing with Pandas dataframes. `physics.py` uses these functions for physics calculations.

The code includes documentation in the form of docstrings.
